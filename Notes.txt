Unit Tests
- focuses on individual code units
- tested in isolation
- specs are easy to write and run fast
- entire program is not tested very well 


E2E Tests
- focuses on a feature and it's integration with the entire system
- elements are tested together
- specs are hard to write, brittle and run slow
- Manual tests are included here

Integration Tests
- somewhere in the middle of E2E and Uni Tests
- multiple components tested together
